# Machine Learning Projects

**Author**: Arpan Arora  

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects created to practice, experiment, and deepen my understanding of ML concepts.  
Each project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on real-world datasets and clear explanations of the techniques used.

## About
The aim of this repo is to:
- Gain hands-on experience with various ML techniques.
- Work with different datasets and problem types.
- Build a portfolio of projects showing clear steps from problem statement to solution.

Each project section includes:
- Type of Machine Learning
- Subtype
- Algorithm used
- Dataset
- Short description
